```

### Technologies Used

- **React Native** 0.76.5
- **Expo SDK** 52.0.0
- **expo-media-library** 17.0.3 - Photo gallery access
- **react-native-gesture-handler** 2.20.2 - Swipe detection
- **react-native-reanimated** 3.16.1 - 60fps animations

## üöÄ Next Steps to Run the App

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd /Users/nischaysood/Desktop/clean-swipe
npm install
```

### 2. Generate Placeholder Assets (Optional)

```bash
# If you have ImageMagick installed:
./generate-assets.sh

# Otherwise, add your own icons to assets/ folder
```

### 3. Start Development

```bash
# Start Expo dev server
npm start

# Or run directly on iOS simulator
npm run ios

# Or run on Android emulator
npm run android
```

### 4. Build for Device Testing (Recommended)

For full photo library access, create a development build:

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo
eas login

# Build for iOS
eas build --profile development --platform ios

# Build for Android
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

## üìã PRD Requirements Status

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Fetch local photos | ‚úÖ Done | Using expo-media-library |
| Swipe left to delete | ‚úÖ Done | With animations |
| Swipe right to keep | ‚úÖ Done | With animations |
| Undo last deleted | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Shows info message (full undo in Phase 2) |
| Header with counter | ‚úÖ Done | Real-time updates |
| Swipeable photo card | ‚úÖ Done | Tinder-style with rotation |
| Footer buttons | ‚úÖ Done | Delete & Skip |
| Smooth animations | ‚úÖ Done | React Native Reanimated |
| Offline support | ‚úÖ Done | No backend needed |
| iOS & Android | ‚úÖ Done | Cross-platform compatible |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

1. **Undo Feature**: Currently shows an info message that photos are permanently deleted. Phase 2 will implement a temporary recycle bin before permanent deletion.

2. **Photo Limit**: Loads first 100 photos. Phase 2 will add pagination for larger libraries.

3. **Expo Go Limitations**: Full photo library access requires a development build. Expo Go has limited media access.

## üéØ Future Enhancements (From PRD)

### Phase 2 - Polish (Next)
- [ ] Implement temporary deletion queue (30-day recycle bin)
- [ ] Add haptic feedback on swipes
- [ ] Improved card stacking effect (show 2-3 cards)
- [ ] Photo pagination for large libraries
- [ ] Settings screen

### Phase 3 - Smart Cleanup
- [ ] Duplicate photo detection
- [ ] Blurry photo detection
- [ ] Screenshot identification
- [ ] Batch operations
- [ ] AI-powered suggestions

### Phase 4 - Cloud Integration
- [ ] Google Photos sync
- [ ] iCloud integration
- [ ] Cloud backup before delete
- [ ] Multi-device sync

## üé® Design Specs (Implemented)

- **Background**: #000000 (Black)
- **Delete Button**: #FF5252 (Red)
- **Skip Button**: #555555 (Gray)
- **Undo Button**: #4CAF50 (Green)
- **Text**: #FFFFFF (White)
- **Typography**: System default (San Francisco/Roboto)

## üì± Testing Checklist

Before releasing, test:

- [ ] Permission request on first launch
- [ ] Photo loading from gallery
- [ ] Swipe left gesture (delete)
- [ ] Swipe right gesture (keep)
- [ ] Delete button functionality
- [ ] Skip button functionality
- [ ] Counter updates correctly
- [ ] Completion screen shows
- [ ] Works on iOS 15+
- [ ] Works on Android 10+
- [ ] No crashes with empty gallery
- [ ] Performance with 1000+ photos

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Dependencies won't install
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

**Problem**: No photos showing
- Grant photo permissions in Settings
- Use development build (not Expo Go)
- Ensure photos exist in gallery

**Problem**: Animations laggy
```bash
expo start -c  # Clear cache
```

## üìö Documentation

- **README.md** - Complete app documentation
- **QUICKSTART.md** - 5-minute setup guide
- **DEVELOPMENT.md** - Technical architecture details
- **assets/README.md** - Asset requirements

## üéâ Success Metrics (From PRD)

Track these metrics once deployed:

- Photos reviewed per session
- Photos deleted per session
- Average session duration
- User retention after 7 days
- Crash-free rate (target: >99%)

## üí° Tips for Development

1. **Always test on real devices** for accurate performance
2. **Use development builds** for full photo library access
3. **Test with various photo types** (screenshots, photos, etc.)
4. **Monitor memory usage** with large photo libraries
5. **Add analytics** to track user behavior

## üìû Support

- Check README.md for detailed documentation
- Review DEVELOPMENT.md for technical details
- Refer to PRD for original requirements
- Test thoroughly before releasing
