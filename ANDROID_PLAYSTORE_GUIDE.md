```

Your earnings: ₹7,000
Payment date: Mid-February
```

**Option B: AdMob/Google Ads Account (Linked)**
- If you already have AdMob account
- Can link and use same payment profile
- Easier if you plan to add ads later

---

## 🛠️ **In-App Purchase Setup on Android**

### **Step 1: Create Products in Google Play Console**

1. Go to Google Play Console
2. Select your app
3. Navigate to: **Monetization → Products → Subscriptions**
4. Click **Create subscription**

Subscription Details:

---

## 🔄 **RevenueCat Integration (Both Platforms)**

### **The Magic: One Code, Both Platforms!**

**RevenueCat handles BOTH iOS and Android!**

```javascript
import Purchases from 'react-native-purchases';

// Initialize for BOTH platforms
const initializePurchases = async () => {
  if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
    await Purchases.configure({ 
      apiKey: 'appl_YOUR_IOS_KEY' 
    });
  } else if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
    await Purchases.configure({ 
      apiKey: 'goog_YOUR_ANDROID_KEY' 
    });
  }
};
```

**Same code works on both platforms!**
- iOS → Apple In-App Purchase
- Android → Google Play Billing
- RevenueCat handles the complexity

---

## 📊 **Revenue Flow Comparison**

### **iOS (Apple):**
```
User buys → Apple collects → Apple takes 30% 
→ Converts to INR → Pays you in 45-60 days
```

### **Android (Google):**
```
User buys → Google collects → Google takes 30% 
→ Converts to INR → Pays you monthly (15-30 days)
```

**Key Difference:**
- **Apple:** 45-60 day delay
- **Google:** 15-30 day delay (faster!)

---

## 💰 **Pricing Strategy for Both Platforms**

### **Recommended Approach:**

**Same pricing on both:**
- iOS: $4.99/month
- Android: $4.99/month (₹415)
- Simpler for users
- Easier to manage

**Or platform-specific:**
- iOS: $4.99/month (premium users)
- Android: ₹299/month (more competitive)
- Can increase Android conversions

**Why Android pricing can be lower:**
- More price-sensitive market
- More competition
- Easier to pirate (so make it affordable)

---

## 🇮🇳 **India-Specific Android Considerations**

### **1. UPI Integration (Huge in India!)**

**Google Play supports UPI:**
- Users can pay with UPI (PhonePe, GPay, Paytm)
- Much higher conversion than cards
- No international card needed
- **This is a BIG advantage over iOS in India!**

**UPI conversion rates:**
- Card payment: 2-3% conversion
- UPI payment: 5-8% conversion (2-3x better!)

### **2. Regional Pricing**

**Optimize for India:**
```
Tier 1 cities (Mumbai, Delhi): ₹299/month
Tier 2/3 cities: ₹199/month (optional)
Students: ₹99/month (special offer)
```

### **3. Languages**

**Android users more diverse:**
- Add Hindi language support
- Add regional languages later
- Increases downloads 3-4x in India

## 🚀 **Building for Android**

### **Your Current Status:**

You have a **React Native Expo** app. To deploy on Android:

```

**Steps:**
1. Run build command (takes 15-20 minutes)
2. Download AAB file
3. Upload to Google Play Console
4. Fill app details
5. Submit for review
6. Approved in few hours!

### **Option 2: Local Build**

```bash
# If you want to build locally
eas build --profile production --platform android --local
```

## 📱 **App Store vs Play Store: What's Different**

### **iOS App Store:**
- **Review:** Strict, 1-2 days
- **Rejection rate:** 40%
- **Reasons:** Privacy issues, bugs, design
- **Screenshots:** Required for all sizes
- **Description:** 4,000 chars max

### **Android Play Store:**
